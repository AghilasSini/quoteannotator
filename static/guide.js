Mother Wolf lay with her big gray nose dropped across her\nfour tumbling, squealing cubs, and the moon shone into the mouth of the\ncave where they all lived. <quote speaker=\"Father_Wolf\" connection=\"s25\" id=\"s0\">\"Augrh!\"</quote> said <mention speaker=\"Father_Wolf\" connection=\"s0,s1\" id=\"s25\">Father Wolf</mention>. <quote speaker=\"Father_Wolf\" connection=\"s25\" id=\"s1\">\"It is time to\nhunt again.\"</quote> He was going to spring down hill when a little shadow with\na bushy tail crossed the threshold and whined: <quote speaker=\"Tabaqui\" connection=\"s26\" id=\"s2\">\"Good luck go with you, O\nChief of the Wolves. And good luck and strong white teeth go with noble\nchildren that they may never forget the hungry in this world.\"</quote>\n\nIt was the jackal--<mention speaker=\"Tabaqui\" connection=\"s2\" id=\"s26\">Tabaqui</mention>, the Dish-licker--and the wolves of India\ndespise Tabaqui because he runs about making mischief, and telling\ntales, and eating rags and pieces of leather from the village\nrubbish-heaps. But they are afraid of him too, because Tabaqui, more\nthan anyone else in the jungle, is apt to go mad, and then he forgets\nthat he was ever afraid of anyone, and runs through the forest biting\neverything in his way. Even the tiger runs and hides when little Tabaqui\ngoes mad, for madness is the most disgraceful thing that can overtake\na wild creature. We call it hydrophobia, but they call it dewanee--the\nmadness--and run.\n\n<quote speaker=\"Father_Wolf\" connection=\"s27\" id=\"s3\">\"Enter, then, and look,\"</quote> said <mention speaker=\"Father_Wolf\" connection=\"s3,s4\" id=\"s27\">Father Wolf</mention> stiffly, <quote speaker=\"Father_Wolf\" connection=\"s27\" id=\"s4\">\"but there is no food\nhere.\"</quote>\n\n<quote speaker=\"Tabaqui\" connection=\"s28\" id=\"s5\">\"For a wolf, no,\"</quote> said <mention speaker=\"Tabaqui\" connection=\"s5,s6\" id=\"s28\">Tabaqui</mention>, <quote speaker=\"Tabaqui\" connection=\"s28\" id=\"s6\">\"but for so mean a person as myself a\ndry bone is a good feast. Who are we, the Gidur-log [the jackal people],\nto pick and choose?\"</quote> He scuttled to the back of the cave, where he\nfound the bone of a buck with some meat on it, and sat cracking the end\nmerrily.\n\n<quote speaker=\"Tabaqui\" connection=\"s29\" id=\"s7\">\"All thanks for this good meal,\"</quote> <mention speaker=\"Tabaqui\" connection=\"s7,s8\" id=\"s29\">he</mention> said, licking his lips. <quote speaker=\"Tabaqui\" connection=\"s29\" id=\"s8\">\"How\nbeautiful are the noble children! How large are their eyes! And so young\ntoo! Indeed, indeed, I might have remembered that the children of kings\nare men from the beginning.\"</quote>\n\nNow, Tabaqui knew as well as anyone else that there is nothing so\nunlucky as to compliment children to their faces. It pleased him to see\nMother and Father Wolf look uncomfortable.\n\nTabaqui sat still, rejoicing in the mischief that he had made, and then\n<mention speaker=\"Tabaqui\" connection=\"s9\" id=\"s30\">he</mention> said spitefully:\n\n<quote speaker=\"Tabaqui\" connection=\"s30\" id=\"s9\">\"Shere Khan, the Big One, has shifted his hunting grounds. He will hunt\namong these hills for the next moon, so he has told me.\"</quote>\n\nShere Khan was the tiger who lived near the Waingunga River, twenty\nmiles away.\n\n<quote speaker=\"Father_Wolf\" connection=\"s31\" id=\"s10\">\"He has no right!\"</quote> <mention speaker=\"Father_Wolf\" connection=\"s10,s11\" id=\"s31\">Father Wolf</mention> began angrily--<quote speaker=\"Father_Wolf\" connection=\"s31\" id=\"s11\">\"By the Law of the Jungle\nhe has no right to change his quarters without due warning. He will\nfrighten every head of game within ten miles, and I--I have to kill for\ntwo, these days.\"</quote>\n\n<quote speaker=\"Mother_Wolf\" connection=\"s32\" id=\"s12\">\"His mother did not call him Lungri [the Lame One] for nothing,\"</quote> said\n<mention speaker=\"Mother_Wolf\" connection=\"s12,s13\" id=\"s32\">Mother Wolf</mention> quietly. <quote speaker=\"Mother_Wolf\" connection=\"s32\" id=\"s13\">\"He has been lame in one foot from his birth. That\nis why he has only killed cattle. Now the villagers of the Waingunga are\nangry with him, and he has come here to make our villagers angry.\nThey will scour the jungle for him when he is far away, and we and our\nchildren must run when the grass is set alight. Indeed, we are very\ngrateful to Shere Khan!\"</quote>\n\n<quote speaker=\"Tabaqui\" connection=\"s33\" id=\"s14\">\"Shall I tell him of your gratitude?\"</quote> said <mention speaker=\"Tabaqui\" connection=\"s14\" id=\"s33\">Tabaqui</mention>.\n\n<quote speaker=\"Father_Wolf\" connection=\"s34\" id=\"s15\">\"Out!\"</quote> snapped <mention speaker=\"Father_Wolf\" connection=\"s15,s16\" id=\"s34\">Father Wolf</mention>. <quote speaker=\"Father_Wolf\" connection=\"s34\" id=\"s16\">\"Out and hunt with thy master. Thou hast\ndone harm enough for one night.\"</quote>\n\n<quote speaker=\"Tabaqui\" connection=\"s35\" id=\"s17\">\"I go,\"</quote> said <mention speaker=\"Tabaqui\" connection=\"s17,s18\" id=\"s35\">Tabaqui</mention> quietly. <quote speaker=\"Tabaqui\" connection=\"s35\" id=\"s18\">\"Ye can hear Shere Khan below in the\nthickets. I might have saved myself the message.\"</quote>\n\nFather Wolf listened, and below in the valley that ran down to a little\nriver he heard the dry, angry, snarly, singsong whine of a tiger who has\ncaught nothing and does not care if all the jungle knows it.\n\n<quote speaker=\"Father_Wolf\" connection=\"s36\" id=\"s19\">\"The fool!\"</quote> said <mention speaker=\"Father_Wolf\" connection=\"s19,s20\" id=\"s36\">Father Wolf</mention>. <quote speaker=\"Father_Wolf\" connection=\"s36\" id=\"s20\">\"To begin a night's work with that noise!\nDoes he think that our buck are like his fat Waingunga bullocks?\"</quote>\n\n<quote speaker=\"Mother_Wolf\" connection=\"s37\" id=\"s21\">\"H'sh. It is neither bullock nor buck he hunts to-night,\"</quote> said <mention speaker=\"Mother_Wolf\" connection=\"s21,s22\" id=\"s37\">Mother\nWolf</mention>. <quote speaker=\"Mother_Wolf\" connection=\"s37\" id=\"s22\">\"It is Man.\"</quote>\n\nThe whine had changed to a sort of humming purr that seemed to come\nfrom every quarter of the compass. It was the noise that bewilders\nwoodcutters and gypsies sleeping in the open, and makes them run\nsometimes into the very mouth of the tiger.\n\n<quote speaker=\"Father_Wolf\" connection=\"s38\" id=\"s23\">\"Man!\"</quote> said <mention speaker=\"Father_Wolf\" connection=\"s23,s24\" id=\"s38\">Father Wolf</mention>, showing all his white teeth. <quote speaker=\"Father_Wolf\" connection=\"s38\" id=\"s24\">\"Faugh! Are there\nnot enough beetles and frogs in the tanks that he must eat Man, and on\nour ground too!\"</quote>\n\nThe Law of the Jungle, which never orders anything without a reason,\nforbids every beast to eat Man except when he is killing to show his\nchildren how to kill, and then he must hunt outside the hunting grounds\nof his pack or tribe. The real reason for this is that man-killing\nmeans, sooner or later, the arrival of white men on elephants, with\nguns, and hundreds of brown men with gongs and rockets and torches.\nThen everybody in the jungle suffers. The reason the beasts give among\nthemselves is that Man is the weakest and most defenseless of all living\nthings, and it is unsportsmanlike to touch him. They say too--and it is\ntrue--that man-eaters become mangy, and lose their teeth.</text></doc>";
